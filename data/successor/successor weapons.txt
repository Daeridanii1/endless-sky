	description `This weapon is, in its basic principle, no different from the beam lasers produced in human space by Deep Sky. What distinguishes it from those weapons is that this one uses more energy in a single shot than a mid-sized city does in a year, and that the beam it produces is more than sufficient to level that city and the surrounding countryside. Naturally, no ship has the battery capacity necessary to fire one of these from its on-board reserves, so the Successors have resorted to powering them via massive single-use batteries. Unsurprisingly, these weapons are not used carelessly, nor are they distributed among the general populace.`

	description `This signature weapon used by the Successors for generations fires a packet of heavy metal ions that punch through hull armor at close range before dispersing at distance into a spray of charged material that heavily damages shielding. This unique behavior supports a combat strategy in which Successor warships will whittle down an enemy's shields from range and then close in for the kill.`

While landing all the projectiles in a burst on a single target is improbable, the theoretical damage for doing so is quite enticing.`

	description "This shield-penetrating laser is one of the few weapons manufactured independently in Successor space, rather than under the auspices - and restrictions - of the high houses. Unfortunately, and perhaps as a result, it is neither especially powerful nor efficient, though its low cost and space requirements make it a nonetheless relatively appealing weapon choice for those who don't have the fortune of being born into a wealthy family."

	description "The invention of the Pulse Laser was a wake-up call for the more astute in the high houses, as it was the first time in hundreds of years that weapons were being manufactured by groups other than themselves. Most Successors see the turreted version as a continuation of this democratization of violence, while the more paranoid claim that the high houses have infiltrated production and intentionally sabotaged the design."

	description "Rather than a conventional explosive payload, Corrosive Torpedoes carry a highly volatile gel that reacts violently with the metal that makes up a ship's hull. They are very powerful against unshielded targets, but their lack of direct damage makes them ineffectual while a target's shields are active. In order to ensure that the missiles reach their target, they are fired in bursts of three."

	description "Successor ships rely heavily on their speed in combat, keeping their opponents at an optimal engagement range and thereby controlling the fight. It is therefore, unsurprising, that one of the weapons developed by the high houses to give them the upper hand in their skirmishes with each other is specifically designed to slow down enemy ships. The Impedance Missile Launcher fires a burst of missiles which briefly orient themselves towards their target before launching towards it, dealing minor damage, but more importantly disrupting their target's engines."
