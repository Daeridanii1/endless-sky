	description `This weapon is, in its basic principle, no different from the beam lasers produced in human space by Deep Sky. What distinguishes it from those weapons is that this one uses more energy in a single shot than a mid-sized city does in a year, and that the beam it produces is more than sufficient to level that city and the surrounding countryside. Naturally, no ship has the battery capacity necessary to fire one of these from its on-board reserves, so the Successors have resorted to powering them via massive single-use batteries. Unsurprisingly, these weapons are not used carelessly, nor are they distributed among the general populace.`

	description `The Bimodal Railgun fires a packet of heavy metal ions that punch through hull armor at close range before dispersing at distance into a spray of charged material that shreds shielding. This unique behavior supports a combat strategy in which Successor warships will whittle down an enemy's shields from range and then close in for the kill.`

	description "This is one of the few weapons manufactured independently in Successor space, rather than under the auspices--and restrictions--of the high houses. Unfortunately, and perhaps as a result, it is neither especially powerful nor efficient, though its low cost and space requirements make it a nonetheless relatively appealing weapon choice for those who don't have the fortune of being born into a wealthy family."
