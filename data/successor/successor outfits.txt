	"description" "At their peak, the Predecessors were feared not for their ability to overpower their enemies, but through their skill at outlasting them. Many generations later, this philosophy is still reflected in modern Successor shield cores, which are exceptionally powerful for their size but weaken the shield's resistance to incoming fire, allowing Successor ships to recover quickly from sustained damage."
