			`After trudging through several seemingly-dead systems, you've finally found a planet with living inhabitants. The aliens remind you most of octopi: they are substantially taller than you, rising up off of the ground by several long suckered arms. Their skin seems slightly wet and you can see it changing color and texture as several of them watch you.`
			`   After examining you for some time, one of them, an especially tall and brightly colored individual, approaches you, gently sliding over the ground with an unsettling lack of sound. It says something in a strange sharply flowing language that you do not understand and waits for you to reply.`
			choice
				`Say nothing.`
					goto end
				`Introduce yourself.`
			`   You introduce yourself to the alien, but their expression does not reveal any sort of understanding.`
			label end
			`   The alien grunts in a gesture something like a sigh of disappointment and then turns away and says something to one of the other members of the now-gathering crowd. Their skin flashes a bright blue and then they leave, heading towards one of the parked ships at the spaceport.`
			`   When they return, they are holding a small round device which they hand to the individual in charge, who then hands it to you. As soon as it touches your skin, it projects a small but detailed star map of the area highlighting a system a few jumps north of here. It would appear that these people, whoever they are, want you to travel there. `

			`In a similar manner to the last time, you set down your ship at a landing pad at the spaceport on this planet. Different to last time, however, you have been shuttled to a small, out-of-the way area at a great distance from the main spaceport. Several uniformed individuals stand on the landing pad and stand at attention.`
			`	After waiting for several minutes, a shuttle lands on the pad beside yours and several individuals emerge from it. One of them is moving more quickly than the rest, and the guards allow them to pass and approach you. Their skin changes to a rough brown before they begin to speak.`
			`	"Greetings, noble visitor. Thou art human, or do mine eyes decieve me?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, I am human".`
					goto next
				`	"Yes, I am human. How do you recognize humans?"`
			`	"Many years past, before from the galaxy we were untimely sever'd, our people watched upon thine and did note upon thy appearence and thy potential to one day ply the stars."`
			label next
			`	"Then, in the spirit of amity, I, the High Houses of the Successors, and the Grand Academy of Staja-Kella-Oa, would pray present thee with a gift, so thou might comprehend our language."`
			`	One of the guards presents you with a small ornately carved box which you gently hold before opening to reveal an equally ornately-carved pin. Upon inspecting the carving, you are surprised to see that it depicts a clearly human sailing ship, wrecked upon a shoal.`
			`	Most of the guards now begin to leave. You begin to suspect that it was the box and its contents they were guarding rather than your ship.`
			choice
				`	Quietly accept it.`
					goto accept
				`	"What is it?."`
			`	"T'is a device most ancient and precious, from when the theatre of thy people dids't entertain our noble Predecessors. This one was't made one thousand years ago for a performance of thy Shakespeare's 'The Tempest,' so that the audience might understand the work in its original form."`
			label accept
			`	"When thou dost place this upon thy person, it shall translate thy words to our language, and ours to thine. Thou shalt treat it kindly, though, for it is not something we gift lightly."`
			choice
				`	Pin it on your jacket.`
					goto end	
				`	"Wait, if this device is what translates, then how do you know my language?"`
			`	The alien shrinks slightly, and a wave of color runs down their body.`
			`	"I am a scholar of language at the Academy here. I learned thy language, at least as it was fifteen hundred years ago, by examining the records left by our Predecessors when they looked upon thy people."`
			label end
			`	You place the pin on your jacket and you notice it moving: the sailing ship is now gently rocking on the shoal. When the alien speaks again, they sound markedly different, like words carried by the wind. They explain that their race, the Successors, are the heirs to an ancient and long-dead empire, their Predecessors, and that you are the first alien visitor they have had in many years.`
			`	While most of their planets will be open to you, several have been restricted by the "High Houses," the ruling families of Successor space, until you have "proven yourself an ally to their interests."`
			`	Finally, your interpreter gives their name as Sieajaj, and encourages you to spend some time exploring the Successors' worlds, and right before they leave, they suggest you familiarize yourself with the High Houses.`
			`	"Thou art a person of great interest to them, and it is easy for even the cleverest among us to fall victim to their politics."`
