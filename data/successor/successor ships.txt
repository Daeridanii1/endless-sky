	description "During the collapse of the Predecessors' empire, the high houses stored away as much of their wealth and property as they could manage, including their private fleets of warships, which were ultimately passed down for over a thousand years as priceless family heirlooms. Despite being far more powerful than anything else in Successor space, these vessels almost never leave the ground, since the high houses have no desire to risk these priceless and irreplacable ships that are so deeply intertwined with their family history."

	description "This medium Successor warship makes up the bulk of the fleets of the various high houses. It is compact, fast, and durable for a ship of its size, but has relatively limited internal space, and a short operational range. The captains of these ships are often up-and-coming Successor pilots hoping to prove themselves to one of the high houses by demonstrating their mastery of the vessel; while most, of course, do not, the ship's ubiquity and good performance do make it an excellent starting point for those who do."

	description "This tiny shuttle is the smallest vessel operating in Successor space, and the first ship that new Successor pilots are able to get their arms on. Despite their small size, they are capable multipurpose vessels, and are frequently used for transporting passengers and cargo, for short-duration research expeditions, and even as very light combat craft, capable of just barely fitting one fixed and one turreted pulse laser."
