	description "During the collapse of the Predecessors' empire, the high houses stored away as much of their wealth and property as they could manage, including their private fleets of warships, which were ultimately passed down for over a thousand years as priceless family heirlooms. Despite being far more powerful than anything else in Successor space, these vessels almost never leave the ground, since the high houses have no desire to risk these priceless and irreplacable ships that are so deeply intertwined with their family history."

	description "This medium Successor warship makes up the bulk of the fleets of the various high houses. It is compact, fast, and durable for a ship of its size, but has relatively limited internal space, and a short operational range. The captains of these ships are often up-and-coming Successor pilots hoping to prove themselves to one of the high houses by demonstrating their mastery of the vessel; while most, of course, do not, the ship's ubiquity and good performance do make it an excellent starting point for those who do."

	description "The Successors have limited experience in making warships this small, and while their attempt at an interceptor is durable and sports a surprising amount of firepower for a ship of its size, it is also plagued with power and propulsion issues as most of their existing technology was either too large or not powerful enough to yield effective performance. The result is a ship that ambitious pilots call a challenge and prudent pilots call a deathtrap, but continues to see use because of its heavy armament."

	description "This tiny shuttle is the smallest vessel operating in Successor space, and the first ship that new Successor pilots are able to get their arms on. Despite their small size, they are capable multipurpose vessels, and are frequently used for transporting passengers and cargo, for short-duration research expeditions, and even as very light combat craft, capable of just barely fitting one fixed and one turreted pulse laser."

	description `The "Myaede" is neither elegant nor fast, but it has remained the mainstay of Successor commerce since before the collapse of the old empire over a thousand years ago, boasting a spacious cargo hold, heavy armor, and a flexible enough weapons layout to let it fight back in a pinch. Much like the grand heirlooms of the high houses, a familial "Myaede" is often passed down through the lineage of spacefaring low-born Successors, and many of the pilots flying these first took the helm as children under a grandparent's watchful gaze.`

	description "Unwilling to give up on the design of the [Interceptor], House [House] have slightly altered the ship to function as a carrier-based fightercraft, and have found a surprising degree of success. In the absence of large and heavy components like the hyperdrive, fuel tanks, and turret mount, the [Fighter] becomes a tough and deadly carried combat craft that House [House] uses to protect its short-range interests, and to project power at a distance with in combination with a carrier."
