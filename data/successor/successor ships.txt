	description "This medium Successor warship makes up the bulk of the fleets of the various high houses. It is compact, fast, and durable for a ship of its size, but has relatively limited internal space, and a short operational range. The captains of these ships are often up-and-coming Successor pilots hoping to prove themselves to one of the high houses by demonstrating their mastery of the vessel; while most, of course, do not, the ship's ubiquity and good performance do make it an excellent starting point for those who do."

	description `The "Seiitej" is a light attack craft only recently put into production by the high houses of the Successors. While it carries a relatively light armament (by Successor standards), it is capable of outrunning any other ship in Successor space, making it excellent for hunting down traitors or fugitives. It also sees service as an escort in freighter convoys, and to that end, is capable of carrying a significant amount of cargo in its own right.`

	description `Blessed with the honor of being named with the Successor word for "fast," the "Veusade" is designed for one thing: to carry eight shatter cannons as close to an enemy ship's hull as possible, something which it unquestionably delivers on, for better or worse. The designers shaved off additional mass by excluding turrets; the presumption is that a pilot in one of these craft should be able to simply outrun incoming missiles rather than going to the trouble of shooting them down.`

	description "The Successors have limited experience in making warships this small, and while their attempt at an interceptor is durable and sports a surprising amount of firepower for a ship of its size, it is also plagued with power and propulsion issues as most of their existing technology was either too large or not powerful enough to yield effective performance. The result is a ship that ambitious pilots call a challenge and prudent pilots call a deathtrap, but continues to see use because of its heavy armament."

	description `The "Myaede" is neither elegant nor fast, but it has remained the mainstay of Successor commerce since before the collapse of the old empire over a thousand years ago, boasting a spacious cargo hold, heavy armor, and a flexible enough weapons layout to let it fight back in a pinch. Much like the grand heirlooms of the high houses, a familial "Myaede" is often passed down through the lineage of spacefaring low-born Successors, and many of the pilots flying these first took the helm as children under a grandparent's watchful gaze.`

	description `As of the few designs from before the collapse that has adapted - even imperfectly - to the new materials and manufacturing capabilities of the Successors' star cluster, the "Valsaqra" offers an imposing look at the past might of the Predecessors' empire. Today they are mostly used for diplomacy and soft power projection, but the "Valsaqra" is more than capable of taking on a fleet by itself, and is therefore understandably restricted to only the most trusted and loyal captains of the high houses.`
