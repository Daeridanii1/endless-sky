	description "During the collapse of the Predecessors' empire, the high houses stored away as much of their wealth and property as they could manage, including their private fleets of warships, which were ultimately passed down for over a thousand years as priceless family heirlooms. Despite being far more powerful than anything else in Successor space, these vessels almost never leave the ground, since the high houses have no desire to risk these priceless and irreplacable ships that are so deeply intertwined with their family history."
