			`Shortly after landing here, you are approached by a tall Successor in unusual dress; though dark, it shimmers in the light with many little golden flecks. It is unlike any other Successor outfit you've seen. "Greetings, Captain," they say, curiously sonorous. "Noble House Aqrabe kindly requests thy presence in the eastern spaceport reliquary. I've been instructed to take thee there, at thy own discretion, of course."`

			`	They lead you through several restricted areas of the spaceport to a thin tower on its periphery. The room you enter into is tremendous and circular; a shallow watery depression in the center is matched by an enormous semicircular tank that bulges down from above, almost touching the floor as it swoops towards the wet floor. What's inside it proves even more striking, however: soon, what look like the severed limbs of Successors begin to writhe downwards in the tank, each suspended by a number of glittering golden threads that snake up into the dark abyss of the overhead water. You look around to ask your guide what's happening, but they have already left. One of the arms rubs up against the glass, its undead suckers making faint popping sounds as they pass over it.`

How queer an introduction is to thee, for thou art the only one here for whom 't'would be needed." They make a noise you're sure is chuckling. "A scion of Aqrabe's House - by marriage, not by blood.

			`Tilra meets you in a tucked-away part of the spaceport, filled with strange statuary, where they stand in conversation with a small group of Successors. They brighten as they see you approach and offer a perfunctory splay of the arms. "Good news for thee, Captain, for all of us. The data from our expedition hath revealed some measure of the mystery of thy stones. They're oscillators of a sort, ones that sing in tune with the wavers of the wormhole..."

Eighty tons or so would be enough to subdivide those keystones to supply all of the New Houses. We could render our wormhole-crossing armor obsolete - improve our probes, perform more archaeology." They pause, and a wave of color bounds down their limbs. "It could even help solve this mystery of ours. So what thinks thou?"`

They offer a curt greeting of colors when they see you. "I've news both foul and fair for thee," they say. "Thy craft shall not suit for our task.

They pause before adding, in a softer and more cynical tone, "no doubt extracting some favor from Aqrabe along the way.

			`The Raaqa-Puan-Uuoru spaceport is drenched when you arrive, deep in the throes of a massive rainstorm, its sail-like projections flapping in the wind and streaming with water. From your landing pad, a series of automated guides direct you to a hangar built into a circular depression in the ground; the top of it closes over like a bubble, translucent and disconcertingly springy against the elements. You can see the blurry silhouette of a Vujlet parked inside as you enter through the side door.`
