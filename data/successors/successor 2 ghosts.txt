			`Shortly after landing here, you are approached by a tall Successor in unusual dress; though dark, it shimmers in the light with many little golden flecks. It is unlike any other Successor outfit you've seen. "Greetings, Captain," they say, curiously sonorous. "Noble House Aqrabe kindly requests thy presence in the eastern spaceport reliquary. I've been instructed to take thee there, at thy own discretion, of course."`
			choice
				`	"Very well."`
					goto reliquary
				`	"No, thank you."`
					decline
			label reliquary
			`	They lead you through several restricted areas of the spaceport to a thin tower on its periphery. The room you enter into is tremendous and circular; a shallow watery depression in the center is matched by an enormous semicircular tank that bulges down from above, almost touching the floor as it swoops towards the wet floor. What's inside it proves even more striking, however: soon, what look like the severed limbs of Successors begin to writhe downwards in the tank, each suspended by a number of glittering golden threads that snake up into the dark abyss of the overhead water. You look around to ask your guide what's happening, but they have already left. One of the arms rubs up against the glass, its undead suckers making faint popping sounds as they pass over it.`
			choice
				`	(Reach out to touch it.)`
				`	(Leave it alone.)`
					goto interrupt
			`	As you graze the glass with your fingertips, the bodiless arms wiggle and squirm. From beneath you, a chorus of artificial voices speak.`
			`	"four-leg? foreign?"`
			`		"foreign."`
			`	"curious foreigner. alien."`
			`			"curiosity, the fortieth virtue."`
			`		"may an alien be virtuous? discuss."`
			`	"no, think I, for..."`
			`	The voices are interrupted by another, this one startlingly close and real.`
			label interrupt
			`	"I see thou hast met our saints, Captain." Another Successor emerges from behind you. They wear a similar outfit; the only difference seems to be a slightly redder-hued glint. The "saints" now follow them around, probing and slapping at the glass.`
			choice
				`	"Saints?"`
					goto saints
				`	"Are they alive?"`
				`	"Who are you?"`
					goto identity
			`	"No, nor has the cloak of death enveloped them either. They're between things. Like infants that never fear growing; like half-sleepers that never fear to wake."`
			label saints
			`	"They're saints, or relics," they say. "Fragments of unliving minds, free of pain and death, surviving in parts. Each one once a mind of renown, one worth t'be preserved even as a memory. They're intrigued by thee. Only one of them ever saw something of your kind, and it did not expect to ever see one of you again - not even in eternity."`
			`	"And who are you?" you ask.`
			label identity
			`	They splay their arms, a little more subtly than most of the Successors you've seen. "Aqrabe Ia Sola. And you are Captain <first> <last>. How queer an introduction is to thee, for thou art the only one here for whom 't'would be needed." They make a noise you're sure is chuckling. "A scion of Aqrabe's House - by marriage, not by blood. But only just. But no, tell me, how is it that our wormhole grants thee passage 'thout a well-equipped ship of ours?"`
			choice
				`	"I carry a quantum keystone on my ship that lets me pass through all sorts of unstable wormholes."`
					goto keystone
				`	"That's not something I'm comfortable sharing."`
			`	"Oh, don't think we haven't scanned thy craft, Captain! Amateur secrecy shall get thee nowhere." A slow ripple of pale blue cascades over their face.`
			label keystone
			`	"In short, we wish to better know these stones of thine. Their structure, their function, their nature. And by this understanding of one more great mystery, to one day produce our own, less intensive and demanding than the forming of our armors. Aqrabe is willing to pay thee to deliver fifty of these to us, more than enough to offset whatever it costs thee for their acquisition."`
